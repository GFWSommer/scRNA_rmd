abstract = {The success of cancer immunotherapy in solid tumors depends on a sufficient distribution of effector T cells into malignant lesions. However, immune-cold tumors utilize many T-cell exclusion mechanisms to resist immunotherapy. T cells have to go through three steps to fight against tumors: trafficking to the tumor core, surviving and expanding, and maintaining the memory phenotype for long-lasting responses. Cytokines and chemokines play critical roles in modulating the recruitment of T cells and the overall cellular compositions of the tumor microenvironment. Manipulating the cytokine or chemokine environment has brought success in preclinical models and early-stage clinical trials. However, depending on the immune context, the same cytokine or chemokine signals may exhibit either antitumor or protumor activities and induce unwanted side effects. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the cytokine and chemokine signals is the premise of overcoming T-cell exclusion for effective and innovative anti-cancer therapies.},

abstract = {Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.

However, the quantification and visualization of these patterns in a way that informs tissue biology are major computational and epistemological challenges. Here, we present Connectome, a software package for R which facilitates rapid calculation and interactive exploration of cell–cell signaling network topologies contained in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Connectome can be used with any reference set of known ligand–receptor mechanisms. It has built-in functionality to facilitate differential and comparative connectomics, in which signaling networks are compared between tissue systems. Connectome focuses on computational and graphical tools designed to analyze and explore cell–cell connectivity patterns across disparate single-cell datasets and reveal biologic insight. We present approaches to quantify focused network topologies and discuss some of the biologic theory leading to their design.},

We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues.},

abstract = {Our understanding of familial predisposition to lymphoma (collectively defined as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]) outside of rare hereditary syndromes has progressed rapidly during the last decade. First-degree relatives of NHL, HL, and CLL patients have an ∼1.7-fold, 3.1-fold, and 8.5-fold elevated risk of developing NHL, HL, and CLL, respectively. These familial risks are elevated for multiple lymphoma subtypes and do not appear to be confounded by nongenetic risk factors, suggesting at least some shared genetic etiology across the lymphoma subtypes. However, a family history of a specific subtype is most strongly associated with risk for that subtype, supporting subtype-specific genetic factors. Although candidate gene studies have had limited success in identifying susceptibility loci, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 41 loci, predominately associated with specific subtypes. In general, these GWAS-discovered loci are common (minor allele frequency {\textgreater}5{\%}), have small effect sizes (oddsratios,0.60-2.0), and are of largely unknown function. The relatively low incidence of lymphoma, modest familial risk, and the lack of a screening test and associated intervention, all argue against active clinical surveillance for lymphoma in affected families at this time.},

abstract = {Benign lymphadenopathy is a common biopsy finding, and may often be confused with malignant lymphoma. It may be separated into major morphologic patterns, each with its own differential diagnosis with certain types of lymphoma. Most cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia is easy to diagnosis, but some cases may be confused with follicular lymphoma, but key morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular findings may usually distinguish between the two, particularly assessment of bcl-2 staining. Molecular studies to demonstrate B-cell clonality, as well as the t(14;18), may also be of great use in difficult cases. IgG4-associated sclerosing disease is discussed, as one recently described example of a specific type of reactive follicular hyperplasia in which the etiology may be suggested based on pathologic studies. While overlapping with the other types of hyperplasia, a high index of suspicion as well as IgG and IgG4 immunostains will help raise the possibility of the diagnosis that can be confirmed by further clinical studies. Reactive paracortical/interfollicular hyperplasia is another pattern of reactive hyperplasia, which may easily be confused with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly T-cell lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis is an example of reactive paracortical/interfollicular hyperplasia, which may often simulate a malignant lymphoma. Attention to clinical findings, as well as a combination of immunohistochemical stains and in situ hybridization studies for Epstein-Barr early RNA (EBER) will usually allow a definitive diagnosis. In addition, lymph nodes with extensive necrosis may simulate malignant lymphoma. Kikuchi necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis is an example of a benign process with extensive necrosis, which may easily be confused with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical and morphologic features, particularly the presence of abundant karyorrhectic debris along with a paucity of granulocytes, as well as immunohistochemical studies to rule out lymphoma, are most helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 USCAP, Inc.

While heterogeneity between individual patients is known to affect the efficacy of cancer therapy, most personalized treatment approaches do not account for intratumour heterogeneity. We addressed this issue by studying the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas by single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptome-informed flow cytometry. We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subpopulations and compared their drug-response and genomic profiles. Malignant subpopulations from the same patient responded strikingly differently to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subpopulation-specific drug sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-malignant cells, whose gene-expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the frequencies of T-cell subsets varied significantly between the donors. Our data provide insights into the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas and highlight the relevance of intratumour heterogeneity for personalized cancer therapy.},

Macrophages accumulate in fibrosis, but the role of specific subgroups in supporting fibrogenesis has not been investigated in vivo. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the heterogeneity of macrophages in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. A novel computational framework for the annotation of scRNA-seq by reference to bulk transcriptomes (SingleR) enabled the subclustering of macrophages and revealed a disease-associated subgroup with a transitional gene expression profile intermediate between monocyte-derived and alveolar macrophages. These CX3CR1 + SiglecF + transitional macrophages localized to the fibrotic niche and had a profibrotic effect in vivo. Human orthologs of genes expressed by the transitional macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, we have identified a pathological subgroup of transitional macrophages that are required for the fibrotic response to injury.},

Interleukin (IL)-16 is a competence growth factor for CD4+ T cells that can induce a G0 to G1 cell cycle transition but cannot induce cell division. The receptor of this cytokine is thought to be the CD4 molecule, although the binding epitope of IL-16 differs from that of HIV. We have demonstrated that both HIV-1/gp120 and IL-16 induced CD4+ T-cell dysfunction, as indicated by suppression of mitogen-induced IL-2 production. Two anti-CD4 antibodies with different binding sites on CD4 also showed an inhibitory effect on IL-2 production. These results indicate that promotion of CD4+ T-cell anergy via the CD4 molecule does not depend on the binding sites of the CD4 ligands.},

In lymphoma, our knowledge of site-to-site heterogeneity and its clinical implications is still limited. Here, we profiled 2 nodal, synchronously acquired tumor samples from 10 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) using single-cell RNA, B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor sequencing, and flow cytometry. By following the rapidly mutating tumor immunoglobulin genes, we discovered that BCR subclones were shared between the 2 tumor sites in some patients, but in many patients, the disease had evolved separately with limited tumor cell migration between the sites. Patients exhibiting divergent BCR evolution also exhibited divergent tumor gene-expression and cell-surface protein profiles. While the overall composition of the tumor microenvironment did not differ significantly between sites, we did detect a specific correlation between site-to-site tumor heterogeneity and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell abundance. We further observed enrichment of particular ligand-receptor pairs between tumor and Tfh cells, including CD40 and CD40LG, and a significant correlation between tumor CD40 expression and Tfh proliferation. Our study may explain discordant responses to systemic therapies, underscores the difficulty of capturing a patient's disease with a single biopsy, and furthers our understanding of tumor-immune networks in FL.},

We identified signatures of T cell dysfunction from large tumor cohorts by testing how the expression of each gene in tumors interacts with the CTL infiltration level to influence patient survival. We also modeled factors that exclude T cell infiltration into tumors using expression signatures from immunosuppressive cells. Using this framework and pre-treatment RNA-Seq or NanoString tumor expression profiles, TIDE predicted the outcome of melanoma patients treated with first-line anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 more accurately than other biomarkers such as PD-L1 level and mutation load.
