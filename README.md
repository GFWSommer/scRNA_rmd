Here I deposited .rmd & .html files we handed in for a master's course in single-cell RNA analysis. The data came from the following publication: Dissecting intratumour heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas at the transcriptional, genetic and drug-response levels (Roider et al. (2020), Nat Cell Biol 22, 896â€“906.), with the DOI: 10.11588/data/VRJUNV.

Please access the report under: https://gfwsommer.github.io/scRNA_rmd/Q-Team_2_report_WS22-23.html

Many thanks to Yi Bei, with whom I collaborated on this project.
